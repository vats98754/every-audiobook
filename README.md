# every-audiobook
This is a GUI-based application built from Tkinter for XHacks (and to get more experience with GUI construction in python). 
This project uses the gTTS library in conjunction with the libgen-api library to find almost any book and convert it to an audiobook that you can listen to. 
The GUI itself has the following features: 
- pause/play, 
- stop (stops the entire book), 
- next/previous page, 
- volume up/down (this increases/decreases the volume of the audio itself, not of the system on which the audio is being played), 
- an exit button to start listening to another audiobook, 
- a speed up/down button (this is in construction, because I couldn't find a solution online for speeding up an audio file, even with formulae on the sampling rate, in real-time). 

I created this to be able to help my mom, who wants to listen to books because reading them strains her eyes, and since all the paid options for audiobooks are too expensive and their collections are certainly not as big as Libgenisis'. 
In any case, I do want to develop this GUI to be able to have multiple books you can add in a list that allows you to pick and choose immediately which book you want to listen to, 
but I just didn't have enough time due to the time limit on the Hackathon. I plan to do implement this change after the Hackathon finishes.
